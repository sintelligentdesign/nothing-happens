# nothing-happens
Text Adventure engine written for funsies by Ellie Cochran and Omri Barak

From Omri Barak on the [old repo](https://github.com/OmriBarak/Nothing-Happens): "This is the Nothing-Happens text-based adventure. The main project has been hosted on this repository for a small amount of time before I realized I had no time and had made barely any contributions to the project. As such, I have given full control and ownership of the project to Ellie Cochran"
